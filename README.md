# DS6050_Assignment_2

# Prompt
In this assignment, you will implement a three-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the TensorFlow and Keras API to perform a classification problem on the CIFAR10 dataset. You will compare performance of the CNN model with the FCN. You will earn 70 points for this assignment if you successfully complete all implementations with the expected validation accuracies, plus 10 bonus points if your classifier performance exceeds 70% accuracy in Part V. To make it easier for you, some codes have been provided to help you process the data; you may modify it to fit your needs.
